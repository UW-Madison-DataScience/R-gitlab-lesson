## Pushing and pulling between two computers

Let's pretend for a minute that you have a computer at home and one at work. It would be nice your work is kept synced between the two locations. Git + GitLab can help with this.

We are going to simulate the two computers situations by creating a copy of your project in a different location on the computer your are not working on.

The key dynamic we want to follow is *push and pull*.

1. After completing a task, *push* to the remote repo; that way your work is saved to GitLab.
2. When you got to your second device, *pull*; your saved work is pulled from the remote repo into your "work device".

To create a copy of the project on your "work computer", we are going to practice cloning a project from GitLab

- Go to your repo on GitLab and grab the `Clone with SSH` url from the `Code` button. 
- On RStudio, go to `File` > `New Project`. This will open a popup window. Pick the `Version Control` option. Pick `Git` and click `Next`. 
- The next window gives you a place to paste the url you got from GitLab and the location on your computer to create the project. Navigate to your `Documents` folder and name it `work-computer`. 
- Click `Create Project`. Git will make a copy of your project in this new location. Now you have two computers to practice pushing and pulling from each other!
